I enjoy sketching because it allows me to express myself without words. Sometimes I would look at my old art compared to my new art just too see how much i've improved over the years.
Sometimes I take walks when its raining because of how relaxing it feels. Its relaxing because rarely anyone leaves there homes when it rains so its just a peacefull walk.
There are many types of online games, however I enjoy playing an rts game called "starcraft 2" because it may be dead but its still fun. Fps games just feel to intense and sometimes toxic.
I do a short daily workout.
Even though I know school is usefull for my future, I still hate going to it.
I like to wear darker clothes because its harder to notice stains.
The good times pass to fast and the bad times goes by so slow.
